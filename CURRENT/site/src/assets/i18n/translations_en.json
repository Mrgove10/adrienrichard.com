  "intro": "Some people call me a developper other call me a nerd. Both are correct, I am interested in most things related to computers and tech in general. I also love learning by doing, hence why my personal project list is quite long.<br />For the web, I would say I am more of a back end developper (I'm sure you can see from this website that front end is not my strongest point, but if needed I can do it). <br /> In general I love tinkering, making things, I love electronics and IOT devices I have created a few that I use daily.",
